<h2>My top three movies of all-time. </h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. I love the images and it feels like real live events.</p>
<h3>Ex Machina</h3>
<p>This one is a bluckbuster movie ever produced by Nollywood.<br /> It paints the African imagery and poetery like never seen before.<br /> The movie is a gathering of the most talented actors and actresses in the continent of Africa.</p>
<h3>Drive</h3>
<p>Beautiful film, really artistic. Every lover of the green revolution must see this movie.<br /> I was held spell bound from the begining of the movie to the end. </p>
